                  and its use in the development of an application for
                  managing conference paper reviews. In the process of
                  developing this application, we encountered subtle
                  forms of interaction not directly addressed by using
                  continuations. We discuss these subtleties and offer
                  solutions that have been successfully deployed in
                  our application. Finally, we present some details on
                  the server's performance, which is comparable to
                  that of the widely-used Apache Web server.",
