About Artanis
=============

* What is Artanis?

Artanis is used to generate HTML pages dynamically, which is also called a web application framework.

* Who write it?

Mu Lei known as NalaGinrut who is a Scheme-web-mad, which means the guy who choose to die if he can't use Scheme to build a website.

* Why write it?

Seriously, Artanis is written with [GNU Guile](http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/), one of the best implementation of Scheme language.
Someday GNU guys talked about "what language to write GNU website", many guys choose Python. But I think it's strange because GNU Guile
**IS** the official extension language of GNU. And I asked why not start a brand new project to provide web framework written with GNU Guile, and RMS said "it's cool, I like this idea". But at that time, it's just an idea without any plan.

Fortunately, few months later, Guile community holds the [potluck party](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2013-01/msg00007.html) 
to celibrate 2 years birthday of Guile2. It's actually a contest to write cool program in several weeks. So, Artanis was born.
