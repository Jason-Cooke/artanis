About GNU Artanis
=============

* What is GNU Artanis?

GNU Artanis is a framework for web authoring, say, generating HTML pages dynamically, which is also called a WAF(web application framework).

* Who write it?

Mu Lei known as NalaGinrut who is a Scheme-web-mad, which means the guy who choose to die if he can't use Scheme programming language to build a website.

* Why write it?

Seriously, Artanis is written with [GNU Guile](http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/), one of the best implementations of Scheme language.
Someday GNU guys talked about "what language to write GNU website", many guys choose Python. But I think it's strange because GNU Guile
**IS** the official extension language of GNU. And I asked why not start a brand new project to provide web framework written with GNU Guile, and RMS said "it's cool, I like this idea". But at that time, it's just an idea without any plan.

Fortunately, few months later(in 2012), Guile community holds the [potluck party](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2013-01/msg00007.html) 
to celibrate 2 years birthday of Guile2. It's actually a contest to write cool program in several weeks. So, Artanis was born.

* History

In 2012 GNU Guile potluck party, Artanis was born.

In 2013, Artanis was submitted to "Lisp In Summer Projects" contest. And it received "Certificated awesome project award" in 2014.

In 2014 Aug, Artanis became [SZDIY community](http://szdiy.org) official project to build web services on its own server.

In 2015 Jan 1st, the first stable version Artanis-0.0.1 was [released](http://nalaginrut.com/archives/2015/01/01/%5Bann%5Dartanis-0-0-1-released%21).

In 2015 Jan 19th, SZDIY community offered Artanis to FSF/GNU, and RMS has dubbed it as GNU offcial project. So it's GNU Artanis now.

* Who use it?

GNU Artanis is used to build web services of SZDIY community. And some open hardware projects in SZDIY are developping their web services with GNU Artanis.
