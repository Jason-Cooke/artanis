<h1>About Artanis</h1>
<ul>
<li>What is Artanis?</li></ul>
<p>Artanis is used to generate HTML pages dynamically, which is also called a web-framework.</p>
<p>It contains URL-remap(the so-called &quot;URL Router&quot;) to provides the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restful">RESTful</a>
URL. The &quot;URL Router&quot; is some kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_engine">Rewrite engine</a>, which adds a
layer of abstraction between the files used to generate a web page and the URL that is presented to the outside world.</p>
<p>Besides, it also provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" title="what's it?">Object Relational Mapping</a>
which is known that map some kind of object to a table in database.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who write it?</li></ul>
<p>Mu Lei known as NalaGinrut who is a Scheme-web-mad, which means the guy who choose to die if he can't use Scheme to build a website.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why write it?</li></ul>
<p>Seriously, Artanis is written with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">GNU Guile</a>, one of the best implementation of Scheme language.
Someday GNU guys talked about &quot;what language to write GNU website&quot;, many guys choose Python. But I think it's strange because GNU Guile
<strong>IS</strong> the official extension language of GNU. And I asked why not start a brand new project named GLOW(Guile Launch On Web) to provide
a full-stack web-framework written with GNU Guile, and RMS said &quot;it's cool, I like this idea&quot;. But at that time, it's just an idea without any plan.</p>
<p>Fortunately, few months later, Guile community holds the <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2013-01/msg00007.html">potluck party</a>
to celibrate 2 years birthday of Guile2. It's actually a contest to write cool program in several weeks. So, Artanis was born.</p>
<p>Artanis is the core of GLOW, which provides the most of low-level web handler, and other useful API. However, Artanis could live standalone
as a self-contained lightweight web-framework.
Another project named &quot;Ricecat&quot; is the front-end of GLOW, which provides configurations, MVC, automatically template generation...Think about how you
play Ruby-on-Rails.</p>
<p>And any other related project could be work with them, just like <a href="https://github.com/aconchillo/guile-redis">redis</a>,
<a href="http://home.gna.org/guile-dbi/">dbi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aconchillo/guile-json">json</a>...
All of them will compose the so-called GLOW.</p></about-text></div>
